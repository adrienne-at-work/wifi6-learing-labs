## What is Wi-Fi?

Wi-Fi (pronounced *Why-Figh*) might be one of the most important words for modern people. **Wi-Fi** is a wireless networking technology providing wireless network connections and Internet via radio waves. Wi-Fi is the brand name which means IEEE 802.11, the standards for Wireless LAN protocols. (IEEE, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, is the technical professional organization, which also develops global standards. It is pronounced *Eye-triple-E*) 
So Wi-Fi connects your Wi-Fi certified devices to a router, or an access point(AP). Wi-Fi transmits radio wave signal at frequencies of 2.4GHz or 5GHz.

## History of Wi-Fi
The start of Wi-Fi technology turns back nearly 50 years. In 1971, the University of Hawaii built a wireless packet data network, ALOHAnet, connecting 7 computers in 4 islands without phone lines. It acted as a proof of concept for wireless networking. But it was 1997 that the first version of 802.11 protocol, showing up to 2 Mbps speed, was released. In 1999, **Wi-Fi** has gotten its marketing name 'Wi-Fi' instead of the long standard name and the 802.11b standard is approved, showing 11 Mbps maximum speed on 2.4GHz. And 802.11a is released a month later, offering up to 54 Mbps on 5.0GHz. But the cost was more expensive and the range was shorter. In 2003, the 802.11g standard is released, combining earlier versions, allowing speeds of up to 108 Mbps.
802.11n was released in 2009. 802.11n reached the max speed of 600Mps, by utilizing MIMO technology. It uses both 2.4GHz and 5Ghz. In 2014, the fifth generation of Wi-Fi, called 802.11ac is released. It is operating on 5GHz  used Multi-user MIMO and achieved the max speed of 3.5Gbps. In 2019, Wi-Fi 6, the topic of this learning lab, will be released.

## What is Wi-Fi 6?
**Wi-Fi 6** is the latest version and the sixth generation of Wi-Fi and also known as IEEE 802.11ax. It will be finalized at the end of 2019. The goal of Wi-Fi 6 is not only to make its speed faster, but also to deliver *high-efficiency wireless*(HE), which means higher throughput in a denser area consistently, and to improve *Quality of Experience*(QoE). Wi-Fi 6 achieves to serve a reliable and consistent data stream in the presence of many users. 

The current challenges around wireless industry include the increase of ultra-high-density(UHD) content or real-time application such a as AR and VR, the need to support low-power devices in the IoT space, and the Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication(URLLC) like medical control. Wi-Fi 6 is expected to meet these challenges.

## Relation between 5G and Wi-Fi 6
Both **5G** and **Wi-Fi 6** are implemented from the same technological foundation, but they will co-exist to support different use cases. Wi-Fi 6 is suitable for indoor wireless networks, while 5G will be chosen for outdoor networks. For example, Wi-Fi 6 can provide high-performance indoor networks with reasonable cost to high-density areas like stadiums, convention centers, and concert halls. 5G is preferred for the environment traveling at high speed like a car in highway or an express train, although Wi-Fi 6 can also improve normal outdoor connectivity. It is clear that both technologies will complement each other and do a crucial role in many industries.

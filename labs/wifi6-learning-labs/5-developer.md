# What engineers and developers should know about Wi-Fi 6

## What developers can do in WiFi 6 network

#### TWT(Target-Wakeup Time)
As explained on page 3, the device can control the time to pause the Wi-Fi connection by setting TWT. Since TWT is programmable, developers can program their apps to control the time to transmit data on Wi-Fi 6. You should be careful of the tradeoff of battery efficiency versus traffic efficiency.

## Types of apps which benefits from WiFi 6
#### VR/AR, streaming service
Wi-Fi 6 achieves great throughput(>1Gps) and low latency( < 10 ms). This enables users to use real-time application like VR/AR, or streaming service with 4K.

#### low-power apps
Wi-Fi 6 provides the energy saving via TWT and BSS Coloring. Developers can control battery efficiency by controling TWT. This is especially effective for the app for low-battery IoT devices.




# Conclusion
Wi-Fi 6 makes the speed 40% faster than Wi-Fi 5 by 1024 QAM, 8x8 MU-MIMO, and OFDMA. But the key part is that Wi-Fi can deliver the good quality of connection in a high-density area unlike the prior versions. Also, it can achieve longer battery life with TWT and BSS Coloring. It is expected that Wi-Fi 6 provides strong wireless network for the IoT space, AR/VR, or the
